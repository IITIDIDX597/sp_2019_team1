### Subhill
Every user will have a notification page where
they can see changes made to eggs they RSVPed
for and any eggs that were shared with them by
other users.

### Story
As an office employee,
I want to be notified if changes have been made to eggs I've RSVPed for
so that I can manage my commitments to office events

### Acceptance criteria
Given I've RSVPed for at least one egg,
When a change is made to an egg I've RSVPed for by that egg's creator or leader(s),
Then I will get a notification via the notification channels I have activated in my profile preferences
And I will be able to see an alert on my notifications page within the Hatch app.
