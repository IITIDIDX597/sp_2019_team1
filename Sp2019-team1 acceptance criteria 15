When a creator creates an egg, they need to include
a picture, a description, date/time/location, and
choose which category of eggs it falls into.

Story
As a creator of an egg,
I want to know exactly what I need to need to input
so that I can quickly and conveniently share with the office my ideas for possible events.

Acceptance Criteria
Given I'm in a role of logged-in user,
When I click on "Lay an egg"
Then the system shows me the "Lay an egg" page containing "Title", "Description", "Start Time", "End Time", "Location", "Category", "Add an egg-citing image", "Leaders needed", "Participants needed", and "We'll need funding".
