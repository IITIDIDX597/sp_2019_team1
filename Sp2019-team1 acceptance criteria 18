Story:
As an office employee,
I want to be able to see all of the eggs I've RSVPed for
so that I can easily see what's coming up for me and manage my schedule.

Sub-hill: 
Every user will have a notification page where
they can see changes made to eggs they RSVPed
for and any eggs that were shared with them by
other users.

Acceptance criteria:
Given I've RSVPed for at least one egg,
When I click on the "Eggs I've Supported" tab
And click on the "RSVPed For" filter
Then I will be shown only the eggs I've RSVPed for
When I click on one of the eggs I've RSVPed for
Then I will be brought to that egg's info page
And can edit my responses or role related to that egg.
