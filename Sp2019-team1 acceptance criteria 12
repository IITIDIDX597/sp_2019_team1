### Subhill
Employees can see all the eggs on a news feed.

### Story
As an employee,
I want to be able to see all the events that are going on
so that I can attend and be involved in the office community.

### Acceptance criteria
Given I have a Hatch account,
When I input my username 
And I input my password
And I click "Login"
Then I will be logged in
And I be brought to a newsfeed page where I see all current eggs.
