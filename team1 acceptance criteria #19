## Story
As an office employee,
I want to know which eggs still need leaders,
so that I can sign on to plan and support specific events that are of value to the office,

## Subhill
Each egg will say how many leaders are still needed to complete the team that is planning the event.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given that I am logged into Hatch,
When an egg has not received the number of leaders needed
Then the information for that egg will indicate that it is short of leaders.
