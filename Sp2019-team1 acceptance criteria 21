As an office employee,
I want to be able to easily access all the eggs I've supported
so that I can easily decide at a later time if I'd like to RSVP for or lead an egg.

Sub-hill: Eggs that a user "likes" are bookmarked and
added to separate page only that user has access
to so that he/she has easier access to those eggs.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I've shown my support for at least one egg,
When I click on the "My liked eggs" tab
Then I will be brought to a page that displays only all of the eggs I've supported. 
When I click on the eggs on this page
Then I will be brought to the info page for that egg
And can edit my responses or role related to that egg.
